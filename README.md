This application is a [ReactJs][2] application written to serve as a simple Proxy Card creator for the [Star Wars: Legion][1] miniatures game.

As this project matures, there are plans to host it at a currently undiclosed URL, but at any point it can be built from source and used locally.

Plans will be added to this README in due time to represent the current and planned future state of the project, so stay tuned.
